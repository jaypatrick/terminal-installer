In this year of our Lord of 2024, and we *still* cannot install Microsoft's amazing Terminal console on Windows Server products. We can install it on Linux, but not Windows Server.

So, I've set out to create some PowerShell scripts which (hopefully) will get Terminal installed and happy and cozy. That's the plan at least. It should be noted I'm not a PowerShell developer, not by a long shot. If I catch your server on fire, my apologies, but, you were forewarned :-)
